For this assignment, you will create a Temperature Conversion app according to the instructions  below,

The app should allow the user to select either Fahrenheit-to-Celsius or Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversions. No other conversion selections should be allowed, and one conversion must be selected at any given time (no situation where no conversion is selected).
Use the following formulae for conversion
°F = °C x 9/5 + 32   and °C = (°F - 32) x 5/9
The initial temperature value should be entered by the user. 
Pressing a Convert button should calculate the converted temperature value and display it on the screen. Converted values should be displayed out to 2 decimal places only.
The conversion operation, value, and calculated results are added to the “history”:
F to C: 55.0  => 12.8
C to F: 3.5 =>  38.3
Example:
The app must look and act consistently in either portrait or landscape orientation.

Submission Format:
Submit a PDF document with a link to your GitHub Repo and a demo video of at least 5 minutes explaining your code, how the widgets you used work to help you achieve your goal, and finally how your app works. 
Link to a Google document will not be considered.
Please ensure that you run your app either on an emulator or a physical mobile device. Unfortunately, any app running solely in a browser will not be graded, as it undermines the primary goal of this course: to learn how to create functional mobile applications.

Below is an example of how the app might look. Note, DO NOT make yours look like this. Use your creativity in designing the UI for this app. Only make sure that all the content mentioned above is present in the app.
